		<h2>Chilean Cuisine</h2>
		<p> <strong>Chilean cuisine</strong> stems mainly from the combination of traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_cuisine">Spanish cuisine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Chile">Chilean Indigenous Mapuche culture</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chilean_ingredients">local ingredients</a>, with later important influences from other European cuisines, particularly from <i>Germany</i>, <i>Italy</i> and <i>France</i>. The food tradition and recipes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile">Chile</a> are notable for the variety of flavours and ingredients, with the country’s diverse geography and climate hosting a wide range of agricultural produce, fruits and vegetables. The long coastline and the peoples' relationship with the Pacific Ocean add an immense array of seafood products to Chilean cuisine, with the country's waters home to unique species of fish, molluscs, crustaceans and algae, thanks to the oxygen-rich water carried in by the Humboldt Current. <em>Chile is also one of the world’s largest producers of wine</em> and many Chilean recipes are enhanced and accompanied by local wines.</p>
		<p>In the seventeenth century, pastry was popularized by the nuns who baked it in convents. A popular Chilean saying, <i>“tiene mano de monja”</i> (“s/he has the hands of a nun”), comes from this period and refers to someone who is really good at baking or cooking in general. The nuns’ pastry recipes fast become popular among the rest of the Chilean population. During the same period, geese and turkeys arrived in Chile from Mexico and melons and watermelons came from Jamaica. During the eighteenth century, Chilean cuisine started to become more sophisticated, particularly among the aristocracy. Tea and coffee began to replace Mate, Chilean wine became popular and people started to drink chicha de uva, a sweet, undistilled wine made from fermented grapes or apples.</p>
		<p>During the early years of Chilean independence, the so-called Patria Vieja, Chileans celebrated with empanadas, chicha and red wine, which is still traditional today at the annual celebrations of independence.</p>
