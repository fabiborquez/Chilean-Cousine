	<strong>Chilean cuisine</strong> stems mainly from the combination of traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_cuisine">Spanish cuisine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Chile">Chilean Indigenous Mapuche culture</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chilean_ingredients">local ingredients</a>, with later important influences from other European cuisines, particularly from <i>Germany</i>, <i>Italy</i> and <i>France</i>. The food tradition and recipes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile">Chile</a> are notable for the variety of flavours and ingredients, with the country’s diverse geography and climate hosting a wide range of agricultural produce, fruits and vegetables. The long coastline and the peoples' relationship with the Pacific Ocean add an immense array of seafood products to Chilean cuisine, with the country's waters home to unique species of fish, molluscs, crustaceans and algae, thanks to the oxygen-rich water carried in by the Humboldt Current. <em>Chile is also one of the world’s largest producers of wine</em> and many Chilean recipes are enhanced and accompanied by local wines.
